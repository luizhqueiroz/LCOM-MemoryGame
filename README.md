## Memory Game

This project is inspired by the classic Memory Game and incorporates interaction with several hardware devices: keyboard, mouse, timer, video card, and real-time clock (RTC).

The game is implemented using low-level system programming techniques, interacting directly with the programmatic interfaces of common computer I/O devices.

The project focuses on system-level development, integrating multiple device drivers and coordinating their functionalities for an interactive gaming experience.
